* LLM Tools
** Motivation and Concept
*** Problem with LM Workflows
**** Auto completion
***** Awkward for:
****** Consistently changing variable names
****** Code refactor
****** High level code feedback
***** Too low level
**** Chat window
***** Copy/pasting (whole or diffs)
***** Hard to give it the correct context
**** Both stifle its ability to help you code
*** Proposed solution
**** Let LMs share the computer - Same API
**** Shell commands (w/ approval)
**** Text editor commands
Emacs makes this especially easy
Eg) evil-forward-word-end evil-search-forward
** Command Line Tool
*** Demo commands
Flags: message, chat, read, delete, undo, shell, proglang, list, debug
# Start a new chat with ID "example"
lm --message "Hello" --chat example
# Continue the "example" chat
lm --message "How are you?" --chat example
# Read the full "example" chat history
lm --read example
# Undo the last message in the "example" chat
lm --undo example && lm --read example
# List all current chat IDs
lm --list
# Delete the "example" chat
lm --delete example && lm --list
# Ask for a Python code sample
lm --message "Please succintly write quicksort" --proglang javascript
# Ask for a shell command to list files
lm --message "Please set env var fruit to banana" --shell eshell
# Enable debug mode
lm --debug --message "hello"

*** Relation to ShellGPT
You can also `pip install shell-gpt` for a similar interface
**** Similarities
It has equivalents for message, chat, --shell bash, --proglang python, delete, read
**** Differences
Missing other shell types (eg zshell or fish or eshell, which matters for setting env vars for instance), other programming languages, undo, and multiple chats
I'll get into this later, but multiple chats allows you to keep a piece of the context window static, and only add to the part of the conversation that you expect to change often.
 This is one of the main problems of the chat window workflow

** Text Editor Tool
*** Emacs
**** call-claude
***** Use region or curson position
***** Prepend text including flags
***** Flexible output
****** Replace the region
****** Append beyond the current cursor or region
****** Printing the output (in minibuffer)
****** Adding it to the copy-paste ring
**** Read elisp code demo
**** Org mode next task demo (optional)
*** VSCode
**** Cursor.sh
**** Honestly is better, will receive more developer support
** Links and Future Work
*** Emacs: https://github.com/scottviteri/llm-tools
*** VSCode: https://cursor.sh
*** Future Work:
**** GPT Function Call API
Especially for emacs functions
Code interpreter for free with python-shell-send-region
**** Agent Loops
